# FloppyFish

FloppyFish is a small, Flappy-Bird-inspired game I built while flying to America—created entirely mid-air for fun and experimentation. You guide a determined little fish through a series of underwater obstacles, tapping to stay afloat and survive as long as possible.

The game focuses on simple, responsive controls, quick restarts, and that classic “one more try” gameplay loop. It was designed as a lightweight project to explore game feel, timing, and moment-to-moment challenge.

## Gameplay
- Press space to flap and keep the fish afloat
- Avoid obstacles and survive as long as you can
- Simple mechanics with moving pipes
